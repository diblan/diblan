# 👋 Hi, I’m Dieter (@diblan)

I'm a **Java backend developer** with a passion for building sustainable, scalable software solutions. I’ve worked in enterprise environments (Volvo Cars, DXC Technology, APB) where I focused on system migrations, improving test coverage, and introducing modern technologies like **Spring Boot**, **Kafka**, and **Docker**.

💼 **Currently**: Improving my skills through personal projects like [Quizle](https://github.com/diblan/quizle) and working toward AWS certification.

🧠 **Tech I enjoy**:
- Java (Spring Boot, Hibernate, JUnit)
- Docker, CI/CD, Kafka
- Rust (in progress – built a neural network trainer for Othello)
- SQL (Postgres, Oracle) & NoSQL (MongoDB)

📚 **Learning**:
- Rust and systems-level programming
- DevOps practices
- AWS cloud services

🔭 **Personal Projects**:
- 🧠 [Neural Network Trainer for Othello (Rust)](https://github.com/diblan)
- 📚 [Quizle – A self-hosted quiz platform (Java + Spring Boot)](https://github.com/diblan/quizle)

🌱 Always exploring clean architecture, idiomatic code, and software longevity.

💬 Ask me about Java, Spring Boot, testing strategies, system architecture, or transitioning legacy systems.
